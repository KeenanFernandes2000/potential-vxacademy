### 🧠 Task Instructions

1. **Read the Excel File**
   - Use a library like `xlsx` to parse the uploaded `.xlsx` file.
   - Treat **row 1 as headers** — map them to the appropriate DB fields as shown above.

2. **Iterate Through Each Row**
   - For each row, extract values using the header mapping.
   - Validate all fields marked as `Required`.
   - Format fields like `Asset` to match DB structure (e.g. array or ID).

3. **Create Users**
   - Insert each valid row as a new user record in the database.
   - Skip any row missing required fields and log why it failed.

4. **Return a Summary**
   - Number of successful inserts
   - List of rows skipped with reasons (missing fields, email already exists, etc.)

### 🛑 Validation Rules

- Do not allow user creation if any `Required` field is empty
- Validate email format and uniqueness
- Normalize case (e.g. language, nationality) before storing
- Ensure dropdown values (like `Seniority`, `Language`) match allowed options

### ✅ Final Goal

- Admin uploads an Excel sheet
- All valid users are created and saved to DB
- Admin receives feedback on success/failure per row
