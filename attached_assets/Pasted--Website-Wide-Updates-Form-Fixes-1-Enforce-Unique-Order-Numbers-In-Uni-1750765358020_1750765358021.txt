## 🌐 Website-Wide Updates & Form Fixes

---

### 🔢 1. Enforce Unique Order Numbers
- In **Units** and **Learning Blocks**, ensure the **Display Order** field value cannot be duplicated.
- If a duplicate is entered, show a clear validation error like:  
  `"Order number must be unique."`

---

### 🧩 2. Add Required Dropdowns for Context Selection
- **Unit and Assessment pages** must include:
  - Training Area (dropdown, required)
  - Module (dropdown, required)
  - Unit (dropdown, required for Assessment page only)
- These dropdowns must be **required** and validated.

---

### 🖼️ 3. Image Size Fit on “Add New” Forms
- On **all Add New forms** across the site:
  - Ensure uploaded images are **properly sized** and **fit within the designated preview area**
  - Apply consistent styling across all pages

---

### 📥 4. Make Dropdowns Required
- The following dropdowns must be marked as **required**:
  - Training Area
  - Module
  - Course
  - Unit
- Ensure users **cannot submit** the form unless these are selected.

---

### ♻️ 5. Reset Form on Edit
- On all pages where Edit is available (e.g., Units, Modules, Users):
  - When editing and then cancelling or switching to a new edit, **reset the form** to clear previous values.

---

### ⏱️ 6. Duration Field Validation
- On all forms with a **Duration** field:
  - The value must be **greater than 0**
  - If the user tries to enter `0`, show a validation error:
    `"Duration must be greater than 0 minutes."`

---

### 🔎 7. Unit Page Filter Dependencies
- On the **Units page**, the **Course filter** should be:
  - Dynamically filtered by the selected **Training Area** and **Module**
  - Show only the courses that belong to both selected values

---

### 🔒 8. Popup Behavior on User & Role Management Pages
- On **User Management** and **Role Management** pages:
  - Prevent popups from closing **when clicking outside** if the form has unsaved changes
  - Prompt the user:
    `"You have unsaved changes. Do you want to discard them?"`
  - Ensure popups handle **scroll overflow properly**:
    - Content inside the popup should scroll
    - Not the entire page

---

### ✅ Goal:
- Form experience should be stricter, clearer, and more consistent across the platform.
- Popups and dropdowns behave predictably and safely for the user.
